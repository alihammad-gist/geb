To help facilitate the sharing of knowledge on the environment, it is needed to engage stakeholders in order to assess environmental trends to inform policy action. The many issues the planet faces today range from how to sustainably manage dry land areas to understanding the source and scale of marine litter in the deep sea.\nOne of main goals of GEB project is to empower stakeholders to implement the environmental dimension of sustainable development by providing data and information that brings clarity and transparency to the main concerns facing the planet. The Global Environment Outlook, UN Environment's major integrated environmental assessment report series, and tracking of the Sustainable Development Goals indicators play a central role. Through clear assessment of the environment, governments, non-governmental organizations, and the general public are better informed about the issues the environment is facing today, the success and failures in addressing these issues, and most importantly, provide options for action to make sure that the problems of today will have solutions by tomorrow.\nThis is powerful information that can inform the development of robust environmental policies and help in achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development.\nIn order to keep the environment under review, GEB project aims to bridge the gap between the producers and users of environmental information, empowering policymakers and other stakeholders to act on the latest science. The Global Environment Outlook Report of UN Environment Program is a series of assessments that provide a comprehensive picture of how the environment affects human well-being. The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6) sets the stage for implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and will help shape national, regional, and global efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.","publishing_date":null}},{"node":{"id":"Report_12","title":"Need Assessment Study of Selected Stakeholders/Departments at Provincial level for Development and Access of Environmental Information System","document":{"publicURL":"/web/static/4fe8a7ad8e8d61260ef4bf993b1703cf/c4ad6d4b0f6e2cc4c03ee9169610ed2e.pdf","size":711732},"cover":{"publicURL":"/web/static/56a1d36c2cf6f535fc3ee0a16902954d/2bc5ddcf3d02ca60022433aed7f2d70a.jpeg","size":73177},"summary":"The information and communications revolution is shaping a far more integrated economy.\nAddressing environmental and sustainability concerns requires a multidimensional approach that\nis interwoven with the global economy and the planet’s natural systems. Both factors are\nmutually reinforcing. This is because the concept of sustainability requires a global economy in\nlong-term harmony with its supporting natural systems. Following Millennium Development\nGoal (MDG) Number 7 aims to ensure environmental sustainability and requires countries to\n“integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and\nreverse loss of environmental resources.” The links between the economy and the environment\nare manifold: the environment provides resources to the economy, and acts as a sink for\nemissions and waste on the other hand. Natural resources are essential inputs for production in\nmany sectors, while production and consumption also lead to pollution and other pressures on\nthe environment. Poor environmental quality in turn affects economic growth and wellbeing by\nlowering the quantity and quality of resources or due to health impacts, etc. In this context,\nenvironmental policies can curb the negative feedbacks from the economy on the environment\nand vice-versa.\nLikewise Environmental assets add to managing risks to economic and social activity, helping\ncontrol flood risks, regulating local climate and maintaining the supply of clean water and other\nresources essential for maintaining life. This strengthen economic activity and wellbeing,\ntherefore maintaining the condition of natural assets is a key factor in sustaining growth for the\nlonger term. However Pakistan being a developing country with un-wise industrialization and\nrapid population growth is creating stress on the available resources, deteriorating environment\nand affecting public health. Pakistan faces significant environmental challenges from tackling\ndangerous climate change to managing threat to our water resources and bio diversity. The\nprocess of integrating environment into economic decision making in Pakistan is hampered by\nlack of consistent and reliable data & information.\nA holistic approach needs to be adopted to address the prevailing environmental implications of\nthe country, right from data generation & interpretation to policy making and implementation.\nDelivering essential and reliable information on environmental issues remains a major obstacle\nin the country. Presently the state of environmental data and information in Pakistan is much\n1poor, with the idea to remove barriers from environmental information management and\nmainstream global environmental concerns into economic decision making, United Nations\nDevelopment Program (UNDP) together the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) has taken an\ninitiative and launched a project with the help of Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC) i.e.\n“Generating Global Environmental Benefits” GEB in 2018. Pursuant to the Annual Work Plan\n(AWP-2019) of the GEB project, aims to conduct a “Need Assessment Study of Selected\nStakeholders/Departments at Provincial level for Development and Access of Environmental\nInformation System” So that the same may be further explored for improvement in Pakistan”.\nIn that regards, initially 08 nos. of core government environmental departments in Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa (KP) were identified in consultation with the National Project Coordinator (NPC).\nA structured questionnaire was designed for the need assessment study. Furthermore; purposive\nsampling technique was adopted during the survey, in which statistically 5% of the total\ntechnical staff in each department was interviewed. During the survey the prevailing\nmanagement system was assessed in the selected provincial government departments. It was\ndetermined that, currently every government department is practicing old conventional method\n(manual filing/hard form) for data generation and record keeping. As a result of which the data\nremains in shelves rather than disseminated in the form of valuable information for decision\nmaking process. With the idea to introduce environmental information system into the existing\nmanagement system, a decentralized comprehensive environmental information management\nsystem should be introduced by applying the given four different approaches which includes, 1)\nDirect Approach, 02) Parallel Approach, 03) Modular Approach or Pilot Scale\nimplementation and 04) Phase in-Implementation Approach are suggested. These\napproaches/methodologies can further be explored for the successful implementation of the\nEnvironmental Information Management System (EIMS) into the selected government\ndepartments.","publishing_date":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":6,"skip":6,"totalPages":4,"currentPage":2}}}
