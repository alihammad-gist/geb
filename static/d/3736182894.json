While previous efforts in Pakistan did produce Pakistanâ€™s state of environment reports and provincial reports, the ability to produce these reports regularly remained contingent on a functioning system of data gathering and availability. The focus of this outcome is therefore, on strengthening the gathering of primary data, its compilation, and flow to a point where it is housed and accessible as a one-stop shop for consistent data. This will be the data that, at least, various government plans and reporting would source and reference for consistency.","cover":{"id":"/home/cocomo/dev/js/gatsby/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/5e1e4bb4811d2528ad9816b772175897.png absPath of file","publicURL":"/geb/static/5e1e4bb4811d2528ad9816b772175897-41dc79309b24921ff275dfb1f6f1d8d1.png","size":8178,"ext":".png"},"slider_background":{"id":"/home/cocomo/dev/js/gatsby/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/d1f1d8ee9a145b59be6d54515c451983.jpg absPath of file","publicURL":"/geb/static/d1f1d8ee9a145b59be6d54515c451983-e729297d164a8daf32da59e683c0c0ee.jpg","size":224386,"ext":".jpg"}},{"title":"A Coordinated and Robust Environmental Information Management System.","body":"This outcome aims to identify leveraging the investments and efforts already made in Pakistan regarding EMIS and working towards effective coordination and longer term sustainability of what already exists in true spirit of the intended GEF/UNDP funding through the GEB project. In view of the above and the importance of having a functional environmental information management system, it is important to set a realistic plan and its targets.","cover":{"id":"/home/cocomo/dev/js/gatsby/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/366229021b9beeb151480e439cdf3e8d.png absPath of file","publicURL":"/geb/static/366229021b9beeb151480e439cdf3e8d-555b2408317b19964f470b791cdbe3b0.png","size":9612,"ext":".png"},"slider_background":{"id":"/home/cocomo/dev/js/gatsby/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/3114e95fb1b5a852c19097a879cd757b.jpg absPath of file","publicURL":"/geb/static/3114e95fb1b5a852c19097a879cd757b-d77efdcdf54fbfa39d6f310bdf5c3018.jpg","size":190242,"ext":".jpg"}},{"title":"Enhanced Commitment and Capacity for Sustainable Development Planning and Legislation.","body":"The lack of informed public opinion and broader awareness and commitment are in fact two major barriers in integrating locally and globally important environmental concerns in development, and account for much of the lack of progress in the past.
