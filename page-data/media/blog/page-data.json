United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Goal 5 stresses on Gender Equality and at GEB, the goal remains one of the core values. With its initiation, the first thing GEB accomplished was 50-50 participation of men and women in project staff to increase the productivity of the project. Same reward for the same work regardless of person’s gender was offered and the office workplace was designed to exclude gender division and encourage diversity and productivity. \n\nFor youth engagement, internships were initiated and females were encouraged to seek the opportunity, contribute and furnish their skills and performances. GEB project also aims to enhance quality research for the integration of environment and development. For the subject purpose, linkages are being built with selected universities. Fatima Jinnah Women University (FJWU) is the first female university of Pakistan and GEB project has established linkage with them to promote quality research as well as ensure equitable provision of opportunities to females. Dr. Saleem Janjua, NPC GEB project believe in taking all the right steps for productivity and inclusiveness. He firmly believe in provision of opportunities to all employees with a focus on “equity” rather than “equality” and “mainstreaming both genders” instead of women.","author":null,"body_abstract":"Gender equality relates to the equality between men and women with respect to their treatment, opportunities, and economic achievements in the workplace. gender equality in the professional environment can only be achieved when employees can access and enjoy the same opportunities and rewards regardless of their gender.
