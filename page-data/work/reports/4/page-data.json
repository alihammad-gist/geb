But for progress to be made across environmental policy areas\n(whether air quality, water, waste or biodiversity) cross-cutting, systemic flaws\nneed to be addressed regularly. Rules and regulations need to be clear, feasible\nand enforceable. Policy instruments must be well designed and packaged.\nImplementation required should be supported by adequate compliance assurance\nstrategies. All this requires effective supporting institutions, adequate funds and\nenough human resources.\nGood environmental regulations have long lasting implications in achieving\nPolitical, Economic and Public Administration goals. Environmental policies are\nneeded\nbecause\nenvironmental\nvalues are\nusually\nnot\nconsidered\nin\norganizational decision making Process. It is imperative to have effective &\nappropriate environmental policies, because without it, natural resources can be\nexploited easily and even at faster rate.\nIn Pakistan, unplanned industrialization and rapid population is stressing the\navailable resources, deteriorating environment and affecting public health in\nvariety of ways. This can be tackled by integrating environmental policies into\neconomic decision-making process.\nFurthermore; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province, which is among the most\nvulnerable provinces of Pakistan to the negative impacts of Climate Change, needs\nmuch attention in terms of effective environmental policies. In order to tackle the\nprevailing environmental challenges of the province, Academia, Public sector\norganization, Industries and International donor agencies shall put their energies\n1together to develop a centralized mechanism for the environmental data\ngeneration, collection, storage, dissemination and incorporation into economic\ndecision-making process.\nMoreover, the existing environmental policies being practiced by Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa government needs to be analyzed, identify shortcomings and\nsuggest improvements accordingly. In this regards, the Ministry of Climate\nChange (MoCC) together with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)\nhas taken an initiative to launch Generating Global Environment Benefit (GEB\nProject). The purpose of the project is to introduce an advance Environmental\nInformation & Management System (EIMS) into existing government machinery,\nwith the idea to integrate environment and development.\nPursuant to the Annual Work Plan (AWP-2019) activity 2.2.2, of the GEB project,\nwhich aims to conduct a “Policy analysis for identifying the key policy shifts or\nmajor developments that are required to integrate environment & development in\nKP Province” so that the same may be further explored for improvement in\nPakistan.\nIn this regard a holistic approach was adopted to conduct this study. Public sector\norganizations, researchers from academia and environmental practitioners were\ninterviewed. Moreover; the existing set of rules and regulations pertaining to\nenvironment were critically reviewed with the perspective of EIMS. After\nconducting the study, it was determined that the set of rules & regulations being\nimplemented by various public sector organizations are contributing to\nenvironmental protection; however, it does not cover the needs of an advance\nEIMS, because most to the regulations are outdated. It is therefore recommended\nthat existing rules and regulations needs to be revised, keeping in mind the\nprevailing environmental challenges of the country in general and KP in\nParticular. A conceptual framework regarding an effective EIMS has been\nsuggested for the KP-Province following the basic principle of Shared\nEnvironmental Information System (SEIS), which is currently being used by the\nEuropean countries.\nFurthermore, it has also been suggested that, the EIMS needs to be incorporated\ninto the KP-Digital Policy by seeking expertise from the various line departments,\nacademia and practitioners from the industry.","publishing_date":null}},{"node":{"id":"Report_20","title":"Policy analysis for identifying the key policy shifts or major developments that are required to integrate environment & development in ICT/Islamabad","document":{"publicURL":"/geb/static/bcb13221feb1b170d461acf1ad665415-3bef65438f5bbe8cf80b4448e04e3f14.pdf","size":1414826},"cover":{"publicURL":"/geb/static/04bfcb8b65a9fc4abf995d8854b37081-a6d9b8dcb856890a2fcbcfd2d2303b12.jpeg","size":75042},"summary":"Increased population and socio-economic developments, such as urbanization, put\ntremendous pressure on agriculture, biodiversity, climate, vegetation, wildlife, and water\nresources. Human’s exploitation of these resources inevitably leads to environmental\ndegradation in the form of soil erosion, deforestation, increased urbanization and irregular\nsettlements.\nSound environmental management strategies, utilizing appropriate environmental\ninformation as input, have to be in place to achieve sustainable development.\nEnvironmental information includes information relating to topography, soil, geology,\nclimate, minerals, land cover, vegetation, wildlife and land use etc. Environmental\npractitioners can use Environmental Information System (EIS) as a management tool to\ndetermine, organize and manage and the optimal utilization of environmental resources.\nEIS provides a platform for environmental information which can be combined, structured,\nmanaged and made available to planners and policy/decision makers. Pakistan being the\nmember of Rio-Convention, which focuses on the need of Environmental Information\nSystem in its chapter 12 of the Agenda 21, which states that; Governments at the\nappropriate level, with the support of the relevant international and regional organizations,\nshould:\ni. Establish and/or strengthen environmental information systems at the national level;\nii. Strengthen national, state/provincial and local assessment and ensure cooperation/networking\nbetween\nexisting\nenvironmental\ninformation\nand\nmonitoring systems, such as Earthwatch and the Sahara and Sahel Observatory;\niii.\nStrengthen the capacity of national institutions to analyze environmental data so\nthat ecological change can be monitored and environmental information obtained\non a continuing basis at the national level.”\nIn this regard it became mandatory for Pakistan to establish an environmental information\nsystem within the country at national or provincial level to comply the Rio-Convention to \nmeet the prevailing environmental challenges. United Nations Development Program\n(UNDP) in collaboration with the Ministry of Climate change has launch a project known\nas Generating Global Environment Benefit (GEB) Project. The purpose of the project is\nto develop mechanism for generating reliable and consistent environment related data\nwhich can then be incorporated into decision making process. Similarly to improve the\ncountry's reporting process, both to increase public awareness and adoption of\nenvironmentally sound decisions, and to fulfill obligations under international conventions.\nPursuant to the Annual Work Plan (AWP-2019) activity 2.2.3, of the GEB project, which\naims to conduct a “Policy analysis for identifying the key policy shifts or major\ndevelopments that are required to integrate environment & development in\nICT/Islamabad” so that the same may be further explored for improvement in Pakistan.\nUnder aforementioned assignment detail study was carried out, in which different federal\norganizations working on environment in one way or another were approached. Prevailing\nsystem for data generation, storage and dissemination mechanism of each department was\nassessed. Similarly, with the help of consultation process, discrepancies in the department\nwhich is leading to lack of consistent environmental data generation was determined. Web\npages of respective organization were reviewed to see the level of environmental data\navailability and accessibility. Moreover key environmental indicators were also determined\nwhich will help formulate the proposed environmental information and management\nsystem for Islamabad/Pakistan; this will also fulfill country needs of reporting against the\naforementioned\nenvironment related\nconventions\nand\nmultilateral\ninternational\nagreements.","publishing_date":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":6,"skip":18,"totalPages":4,"currentPage":4}}}
